# Contributing to Metrics

Contributions from the open source community--especially first time contributors--are welcome and encouraged. Thank you for taking an interest in this project.

# If you have a question about the package or an idea for the package

You should [open up a new issue](https://github.com/mfrasco/Metrics/issues/new) that describes your question or your idea. Be sure to look through the existing issues.

You can ask questions about how a function works, about the documentation for a function, or about the package in general. If you have an idea for a new metric function that can be added to the package, be sure to describe how the metric is used.

# What to do if you found a bug

You should [open up a new issue](https://github.com/mfrasco/Metrics/issues/new) that provides a reproducible example of the bug. If you've never heard of a reproducible example (or reprex) before, you can read about them [here](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex#what-is-a-reprex). The goal of a reprex is to make it as easy as possible for me to recreate your problem so that I can fix it.

# What to do if you've fixed a bug or added a new feature

If this is your first contribution to an open source project, I recommend that you [read this](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#how-to-submit-a-contribution).

Otherwise, please make the pull request from your forked repo against the master branch of this repo.
