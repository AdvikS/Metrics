# Metrics

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mfrasco/Metrics.png)

## Background On This Repo

This repository contains the code for the **Metrics** package in R. That package was created by Ben Hamner, and its original home is located [at this github repo](https://github.com/benhamner/Metrics/). That repo contains packages for common machine learning metrics in several languages, not just R. However, on 2017-04-21, the R package was orphaned by CRAN. In an effort to revive the status of the R package, I cloned the original and created this repo.

## How to Install this Package

From the R prompt, run ```install.packages("Metrics")```.
